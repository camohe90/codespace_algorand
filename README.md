# The All-in-One Algorand Codespace

Welcome to the all-in-one Algorand Codespace! This repository is designed to provide you with everything you need to start developing on the Algorand blockchain, whether you're attending a workshop, completing a challenge, or just exploring on your own.

## 🌟 Quick Start Guide

### **Fork the Repo:**

To create your own copy of this repository:

a. **Go to the GitHub Repository:**
   - Navigate to the main page which is the current one your on.

b. **Click the "Fork" Button:**
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

c. **Wait for the Forking Process to Complete:**
   - GitHub will take a few moments to create the fork. Once complete, you’ll be redirected to your newly created fork.

## 🚀 Start with Codespaces
This is the fastest way to get up and running!

1. **Create a Codespace:**

**Mini video showecasing how simple it is incoming!**

   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right of your forked repo.
   - Select "Create codespace on main".
   - Once your Codespace is fully loaded, you are ready to go!

2. **Start Coding:**
   - Open the `main.py` file to start coding and interact with the Algorand blockchain (no smart contracts needed).
   - If you notice your codespace loaded with a similar error to the screenshot below, no worries! Just run ``` algokit localnet start ```

 - Lastly the ```main.py``` file is pre-populated with a simple script to quickly set up a local dispenser on the Algorand blockchain. This helps you get started immediately by connecting to the localnet and printing the dispenser address. Run it! ```python main.py``` like any other Python file :)

3. **Workshop Follow-Along:**
   - If you're participating in a workshop, the code we’ll be using is available [here](https://github.com/Ganainmtech/python_algokit_demo). Feel free to use this as your experiemntation starting point too, we create an asset!

4. **Explore on Your Own:**
   - Use this environment to write your own scripts or modify existing ones.

5. **Smart Contracts and Apps on-chain:**
   - To start a smart contract or full stack App project, run:
   - Note: If you are at this point, I recommend you get AlgoKit locally - codespaces are a premium feture of github and can get deleted!
     ```bash
     algokit init
     ```

## 💻 Advanced Setup for Local Development

Prefer a local environment? Follow these steps:

#### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.12 or higher.
- Install [AlgoKit](https://developer.algorand.org/algokit/?utm_source=af_employee&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=algokit_sarajane&utm_content=download&utm_term=EME).
- Install Docker (for running a local Algorand network).

## 🎓 Workshop Challenges

If you’re taking part in a workshop challenge you can choose to fork and enter codespace or fork and work locally:

1. **Live coding follow along:** 
   - Complete the task provided during the workshop.

2. **Submit Your Answer:**
   - Push your changes to your forked GitHub repository.
   - Create a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository.
   - In your PR, include:
     - What your script achieves. (Optional)
