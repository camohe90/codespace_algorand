# The All-in-One Algorand Codespace

Welcome to the all-in-one Algorand Codespace! This repository is designed to provide you with everything you need to start developing on the Algorand blockchain, whether you're attending a workshop, completing a challenge, or just exploring on your own.

## üåü Quick Start Guide

### **Fork the Repo:**

To create your own copy of this repository:

a. **Go to the GitHub Repository:**
   - Navigate to the main page which is the current one your on.

b. **Click the "Fork" Button:**
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

c. **Wait for the Forking Process to Complete:**
   - GitHub will take a few moments to create the fork. Once complete, you‚Äôll be redirected to your newly created fork.

## üöÄ Start with Codespaces
This is the fastest way to get up and running!

1. **Create a Codespace:**


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1513fd15-b55a-48e5-8b97-ba128a74fe43


     *Click the image above to watch a quick 15-second video on how to create your Codespace.*
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right of your forked repo.
   - Select "Create codespace on main".
   - Once your Codespace is fully loaded, run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     sh algorand_setup.sh
     ```

2. **Start Coding:**
   - Open the `main.py` file to start coding and interact with the Algorand blockchain (no smart contracts needed).
   - To start a smart contract/dApp project, run:
     ```bash
     algokit init
     ```

3. **Workshop Follow-Along:**
   - If you're participating in a workshop, the code we‚Äôll be using is available [here](https://github.com/Ganainmtech/python_algokit_demo).

4. **Explore on Your Own:**
   - Use this environment to write your own scripts or modify existing ones.

## üíª Advanced Setup for Local Development

Prefer a local environment? Follow these steps:

#### üß∞ Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.12 or higher.
- Install [AlgoKit](https://developer.algorand.org/algokit/?utm_source=af_employee&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=algokit_sarajane&utm_content=download&utm_term=EME).
- Install Docker (for running a local Algorand network).

#### üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Fork & Clone the Repository:**


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6942cc23-72c1-4d89-a4aa-f2f4fe8fcfe0


     *Watch this video to see how to fork and clone a repository.*
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     cd [DIRECTORY_OF_YOUR_CHOICE]
     git clone [FORKED_REPO_URL]
     ```

2. **Open in VSCode:**
   - Open the repository with your code editor.

3. **Bootstrap Your Project:**
   - Navigate to the [`main.py`](./main.py) file.
   - Run the following command to set up your environment for simple scripts:
     ```bash
     sh algorand_setup.sh
     ```
   - If you are looking into smart contracts and algokit run the following commands:
     ```bash
     algokit init
     algokit project bootstrap
     ```
   - This installs dependencies and generates a `.env` file if you are using algokit.

## üéì Workshop Challenges

If you‚Äôre taking part in a workshop challenge you can choose to fork and enter codespace or fork and work locally:

1. **Live coding follow along:** 
   - Complete the task provided during the workshop.

2. **Submit Your Answer:**
   - Push your changes to your forked GitHub repository.
   - Create a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository.
   - In your PR, include:
     - What your script achieves. (Optional)

## üìö Additional Resources
